## Inverse Cumulative Palindrome

### A simple program to solve an interesting problem.

Problem statement goes below.

- You are given a number e.g 67. You have to check whether its palindrome or not.
- If yes , problem ends here.
- If not , you have to find a number that is fornt digit rear to the given number , such as 67 is the given number and 76 is resultant.
- Now you have to find the sum of those two numbers and check if its palindorme or not. (For the sake of explanation 67 + 76 = 143 which is not a palindrome.)
- If not , repeat the the whole process from the first step with the sum until you come up with a palindorme number.

### This is what I solved using C#.

## Limitations

I wans't able to find a result for those two numbers below using this program.

- 196
